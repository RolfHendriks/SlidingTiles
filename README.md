## Overview

Demonstrates a proof of concept for a tile based layout. Rearrange tiles by touching and holding on a tile, then 
dragging it. Select a tile by tapping it. 

This project is intended for educaitonal purposes. The reason I made this project was not because I needed a tile 
based menu system, but because I was learning Android and wanted a project to explore layout, animation, and 
interaction in depth.

## Features

* Custom reusable gesture detection with configurable touch tracking and touch slop
* Custom reusable spring animations
* Custom reusable view frame animator to smoothly animate both the position and size of an object
* Reusable view layout and debugging utilities
* Flexible tile layout using zero lines of code
